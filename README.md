# NaiveJS

NaiveJS is a personal experimental JavaScript engine. My primary goal is to explore the implementation of well-known features in JavaScript such as closures, event loops, objects, etc., rather than implementing the language strictly according to the ECMA specification. Having said that, I do hope to bring NaiveJS closer to the specification as time goes on.
